This was my first complete SQL project i created. In this project, I learned how to:

1) Create and Drop Tables in SQL
  
2) Insert Data and Invoices into tables
3)  How to create invoice line tables
4) How to insert Data into Invoice Lines
5) How to JOIN two tables
6) Comparing JOINs, IN and EXISTS operators
7) How to use JOIN, WHERE, and EXISTS operators in SQL and many more.

It was exciting to see how everything came together
